  <h1>BodyLapse – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> August 30, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Controller:</strong> Bronyte Studios — Contact: <a href="mailto:bronytestudios@gmail.com">bronytestudios@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>What BodyLapse does</h2>
  <p>BodyLapse helps you create a personal body-transformation timelapse by taking or adding photos and exporting a video.</p>

  <h2>Data we process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos & videos you add:</strong> Stored <em>locally on your device</em> only. We do not upload them to any server.</li>
    <li><strong>App settings & purchases:</strong> Stored locally; purchase status is also managed by Google Play.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> none.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising (AdMob):</strong> AdMob (Google) may collect device identifiers, IP address, coarse location, and performance metrics to show ads.</li>
    <li><strong>In-app purchases (Google Play Billing):</strong> Payments are processed by Google Play. We receive purchase tokens/receipts but no payment card details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Camera, Photos, Microphone</h2>
  <p>- Camera is used to capture photos.<br>
     - Microphone: the app does not record microphone audio by default; if you add audio to exports, it comes from files you choose.<br>
     - Photos/Media/Files permission is used to read/write media you select or export.
  </p>

  <h2>Where your data lives</h2>
  <p><strong>On device:</strong> Your media, settings, and exports remain on your device until you delete them.</p>
  <p><strong>Third parties:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google AdMob (ads)</li>
    <li>Google Play (billing)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
  <p>- Ads: consent (where required).<br>
     - Non-personalized ads or ad measurement: legitimate interests, where permitted.<br>
     - Purchases & app functionality: contract performance and legitimate interests.
  </p>

  <h2>Consent & choices</h2>
  <p>In the EEA/UK, we use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) for consent.  
  You can change consent in <em>Settings → Ads preferences</em> (or via OS ad settings).  
  You can also opt out of ad personalization in your Google account settings.</p>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>- On-device media and settings: until you delete them or uninstall the app.<br>
     - Purchase records: retained as required for accounting, tax, and fraud prevention.<br>
     - AdMob data: per Google’s policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>BodyLapse is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

  <h2>Your rights (GDPR/EEA/UK)</h2>
  <p>You may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or port your personal data, and to object to certain processing.  
  To exercise these, contact us at <a href="mailto:bronytestudios@gmail.com">bronytestudios@gmail.com</a>.  
  You can also lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</p>

  <h2>International transfers</h2>
  <p>AdMob/Google may process data globally (including the U.S.). Google applies appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) as described in their privacy documentation.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. We will change the “Effective date” above and may notify you in-app.</p>
