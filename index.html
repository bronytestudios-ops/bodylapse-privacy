What BodyLapse does

BodyLapse helps you create a personal body-transformation timelapse by taking or adding photos and exporting a video.

Data we process

Photos & videos you add: Stored locally on your device only. We do not upload them to any server.

Analytics: none.

Advertising (AdMob): AdMob (Google) may collect device identifiers, IP address, coarse location, and performance metrics to show ads. See Google’s privacy policy and AdMob’s data use.

In-app purchases (Google Play Billing): Payments are processed by Google Play. We receive purchase tokens/receipts but no payment card details.
